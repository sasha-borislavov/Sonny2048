# Sonny Angel 2048 (NAME TBD)

Sonny Angel 2048 is a cute twist on the original 2048 game, where instead of matchning numbers, you match Sonny Angel Characters. This game is a small quick side-project in learning pygame, and is dedicated to my two close friends, who are a little too obsessed with gacha games.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to move the tiles in any direction: up, down, left, or right.
2. When two tiles with the same Sonny Angel face touch, they merge into one!
3. Keep merging the faces to reach the ultimate goal (the rarest and cutest Sonny Angel tile): Pink Robby Angel!

## Credits

Sonny Angel 2048 is inspired by the original 2048 game created by Gabriele Cirulli.
